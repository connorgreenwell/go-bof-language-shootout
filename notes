# Go & concurrency
	- Go is built around concurrency. There are two features that drive Go's concurrency: goroutines and channels.

# goroutines
	- portmanteu of "go" and "coroutine"
	- splits function off onto its own stack.
	- main stack doesnt wait for other goroutines

# channels
	- channels allow for communication between goroutines

# queue
	- this example spins off three goroutines that all read from the same channel and print out the read values.
